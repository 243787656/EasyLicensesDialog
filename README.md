### Instructions:

There are two versions: the standard version and the AppCompat version (with Material Design).

####Step: 1
Include your prefered version of [easylicensesdialog.jar](https://github.com/marcoscgdev/EasyLicensesDialog/blob/master/library) to your _libs_ folder.

####Step 2:
Edit the [licenses.html](https://github.com/marcoscgdev/EasyLicensesDialog/tree/master/html%20file) file and include it into your _assets_ folder. Is *very important* that this file has the same name as here!
